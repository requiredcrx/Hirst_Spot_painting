# Hirst Painting

This project creates a painting inspired by the work of Damien Hirst. It uses the Python Turtle graphics library to draw a grid of colored dots. The colors of the dots are randomly generated, and the grid is arranged in a checkerboard pattern.


## Description

The program uses the turtle module to create a turtle object named "required" that moves around the screen and paints colorful dots. The dot colors are randomly selected from a predefined list of RGB color values.

The dots are placed in a grid-like pattern, with each row containing 10 dots. Once a row is completed, the turtle moves to the next row and continues painting until the desired number of dots is reached.


## How to Run the Program

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., "main.py").
Run the Python file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE).
The turtle graphics window will open, and you will see the Hirst painting being created.
Close the turtle graphics window when you are done viewing the painting.


## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python module:

```turtle:``` This module provides a way to create graphics and shapes using turtle graphics.
Example Output

Here is an example of what the Hirst painting created by this program may look like:

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the artwork of **Damien Hirst***, known for his colorful dot paintings. The turtle module in Python is used to recreate a simplified version of his art style.

**Note:** The actual output of the program may vary due to the random color selection.
